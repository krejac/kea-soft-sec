## Reading notes

> "Although the traditional way of testing addresses most of the application requirements and verifies that the use case scenarios have been implemented, it often doesn't test the scenarios and actions that an application is *not* supposed to allow. Attact use cases and their related test scenarios (such as based on attack patterns) that can circumvent any type of security in place generally are not even considered."  (AoST pp. 7)

> "A program that correctly implemens all its "shoulds" -- the functional and operational requirements--can still be insecure because of the "shouldn'ts" or "don't allows" that are still there and that have not been addressed or have been overlooked." (AoST pp. 8)

**Keywords**: *attack surface*, *attack patterns*, *fault injection*, *security design errors*
