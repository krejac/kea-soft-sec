# Lab setup and Programming Knowledge

**Todays reading**: Linux introduction and familiarisation. 

AoST chapter 1. 

## Reading notes

> "Although the traditional way of testing addresses most of the application requirements and verifies that the use case scenarios have been implemented, it often doesn't test the scenarios and actions that an application is *not* supposed to allow. Attact use cases and their related test scenarios (such as based on attack patterns) that can circumvent any type of security in place generally are not even considered."  (AoST pp. 7)

> "A program that correctly implemens all its "shoulds" -- the functional and operational requirements--can still be insecure because of the "shouldn'ts" or "don't allows" that are still there and that have not been addressed or have been overlooked." (AoST pp. 8)

**Keywords**: *attack surface*, *attack patterns*, *fault injection*, *security design errors*

## Lecture notes
Slides: [[1-programming-and-lab-setup.pdf]]

- Kvalitet er ofte lig med sikkerhed.
- SDLC: Software Development Life Cycle (princip)
- Advice: RTFM!

### Goals of security
- Prevention
- Detection
- Recovery

### Overview of Sofware Security
- Security testing vs. Traditional Testing
- Functional testing does not prevent security issues
- SQL injection
- Attackers try to break the application, server, OS, etc.
- Use methods like user input, memory corruption / buffer overflow, poor exception handling broken auth. ... etc.

### Exercises
6, 7 & 8.

Der var en del fra dagens slides, som vi ikke nåede igennem. Det startede næste undervisning med.
