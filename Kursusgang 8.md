	- Recurring code patterns
	- Patterns in Network Architecture


### Common constructs
- Solve problems in the same domains
- Need to store lists of strings / characters etc.
- Data structures becomes useful in other programs
- Sorting routines needed in many programs

**Structure and Object Mismanagement**
- Structures in C can help group related data elements
- Both auditors and attackers can benefit ...
- Object oriented programs and languages encapsulate this
- Responsibility is on the object implementation, good!
- We saw structures last time
