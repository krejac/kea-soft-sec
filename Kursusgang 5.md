### What we learnt from the recon part

> In Part I of this book, “Recon,” we explored a number of ways to investigate and document the structure and function of a web application. We evaluated ways of find‐ ing APIs on a server, including those that exist on subdomains rather than at just the top-level domain. We considered methods of enumerating the endpoints that those APIs exposed, and the HTTP verbs that they accepted.

- We are allowed to do reconnaissance
- Having a good inventory of software, hardware, devices, etc. makes it easier to control and secure
- Having knowledge about patching levels is vital!
